# PinholeFinder

jack.lee@rice.edu

This module will automatically align an optical pinhole to allow a laser to pass through it using artificial intelligence.

To run:

Build ML model with pinhole_aligner.py (alternatively ask me for download link)

Run autoaligner.py and sit back

My file hygiene was honestly not the best here. alignmentML.py is an outdated version of pinhole_aligner.py but it has better commenting. Feel free to reference.
