# PinholeFinder

jack.lee@rice.edu

This module will automatically align an optical pinhole to allow a laser to pass through it using artificial intelligence.

To run:

Build ML model with alignmentML.py (alternatively ask me for download link)
(pinhole_aligner.py is a prototype file that should do the same thing, if alignmentML doesn't work please use that one and let me know)

Run autoaligner.py and sit back
